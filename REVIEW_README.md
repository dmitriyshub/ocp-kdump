# Summary for the Reviewer

The KDUMP repository provides a comprehensive guide for configuring and troubleshooting kdump on OpenShift nodes. This documentation includes detailed step-by-step instructions, configuration examples, and an in-depth guide on utilizing the crash tool to analyze and investigate vmcore files generated during a system crash.

This summary will guide the reviewer through the KDUMP implementation and documentation review process. The review is divided into two primary sections:

1. Complete the kdump guide, which focuses on the crash tool analysis guide and vmcore file analysis. The objective is to ensure the guide is comprehensive, logically structured, and user-friendly, enabling users to implement and troubleshoot kdump in OpenShift environments effectively

- [KDUMP in OpenShift CoreOS Baremetal Nodes Guide](https://gitlab.med.one/compute/ocp-kdump)

2. Review the merge request for MachineConfig deployment. The goal is to ensure that MachineConfig is implemented correctly, is easily reproducible, and aligns with the best practices outlined in the KDUMP guide

- [KDUMP MachineConfig Merge Request !320](https://gitlab.med.one/compute/ocpbm-cluster-config/-/merge_requests/320)

**NOTE** This merge request implements the kdump local path configuration due to an identified bug in the kexec-tools affecting the SSH target path in the current OpenShift version. We plan to use the SSH target path once our clusters are upgraded to OpenShift version 4.14!

## Review Focus

This review will focus primarily on the KDUMP documentation, particularly the table of contents, to ensure it is complete, logically structured, and easy to navigate. While the focus of this review is on the KDUMP documentation itself, the next section of the document will include links to official documentation, blogs, and other external resources that may be helpful. However, these resources are outside the scope of this review and should be considered supplementary.

### Key Sections to Review

The following sections are the most important and should be reviewed in detail!

- **KDUMP Introduction and Key Concepts:** This section introduces KDUMP and provides the foundational knowledge required to understand its purpose and functionality. It is essential to set the stage for the rest of the documentation and ensure that users understand before diving into more complex configurations

- **KDUMP MachineConfig Configuration:** This section outlines the process for configuring KDUMP using MachineConfigs on OpenShift nodes, allowing the users to implement KDUMP configurations without errors

- **Crash Tool Custom Container to Analyze a vmcore:** This section uses a custom container equipped with the crash tool and all the requirements to analyze vmcore files generated during system crashes. The review should ensure that the documentation provides clear instructions on how to set up and use this container effectively

- **Crash Tool Guide:** As the most critical section of the documentation, the Crash Tool Guide provides detailed steps and examples for analyzing vmcore files. It is necessary to ensure that this section is clear, comprehensive, and includes sufficient examples to guide users through troubleshooting. Special attention should be given to the accuracy and usability of the examples provided

### Useful information

- You can find vmcore files on the `phmowrk-166014-15` node under the `/var/crash` directory. If needed, you can manually trigger a crash on the host to generate a new vmcore file for analysis

- Utilize the preconfigured kdump-crash-tool images available in [Medone Quay Container Registry](https://quay.med.one:8443/repository/openshift/kdump-crash-tool?tab=tags)

1. `4.18.0-372.73.1` this is the default image tag, designed to work with a mounted vmcore file

2. `4.18.0-372.73.1-clean` This variant has no entrypoint, making it ideal for troubleshooting within the container environment

### Review Goal

The ultimate goal of this review is to ensure that:

1. The KDUMP documentation is clear, logically organized, and user-friendly

2. The MachineConfig deployment is correctly implemented, easily reproducible, and aligns with the guidance provided in the KDUMP documentation

3. Users of the KDUMP system have all the necessary tools and knowledge to configure, troubleshoot, and analyze vmcore files effectively
